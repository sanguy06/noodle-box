# Noodle Box
Noodle Box is our own spin-off on a digital blind box! Each blind box contains a noodle-timer, with a pop-up to help you keep track of time while cooking. 

# Implementation
* Used React, JavaScript, CSS/HTML
* Designed and imported images
* Worked with event-driven programming

# Future Goals
* Add in more timers
* Clean up animations
* Gamify it- add in games that users can play to unlock more noodle timers!
